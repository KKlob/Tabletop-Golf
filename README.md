# Tabletop Golf
The premise is bringing golf to the tabletop via dice roll mechanics and a DnD style equipment system. Solo play is available though it is encouraged to play as 2-4 players + 1 GM. GM is an optional role but it makes it more fun. The twist is the game is a PvP type game. As in golf, the objective is to score the lowest you can and beat the other golfers in your group. You are competing against the other players. Along your round of 18 holes, you will have opportunities to acquire new equipment in the form of Clothes and Clubs. You will also be able to grab shot modifiers that can change the roll requirements for a shot as well as one-time-use abilities that can help your golf game or hamper an opponent. Who will come out on top?

Every three holes is considered a "Match". After each Match, each golfer is given stat points to distribute, new equipment option, and other choices. After each golfer is satisfied, the next Match begins. After 6 Matches, the Player with the lowest strokes is the winner. In case of a tie, a Playoff Match will start. No stat points are given after the 6th Match nor any Playoff Match. Only equipment / shot modifiers / etc. will be offered.

## Create your Golfer
To create a golfer, a player must distribute stat points among the different attributes of their golfer
 - Power : Influences all golf clubs. Main influence in determining distance.
 - Technique : Influences all golf clubs. Main influence in determining contact with the ball.
 - Control : Influences all golf clubs. Main influence in determining control over ball flight.
 - Finesse : Influences irons and wedges. Main influence in determining ball spin.
 - Luck : Influences kick + lucky saving throws. Main influence in determining hole outs / close putts.

Each attribute starts with 1 point. A Player is given 10 points to distribute, with an additional 3 points given after every Match.

After creating a golfer, the player will receive a base bag of rental clubs from the course. These clubs all have the same stats and requirements. All golfers are equipped with base clothing (Hat, shirt, pants, shoes, gloves) that have no modifiers on them. There will be opportunities to acquire new clubs, equipment, and other gear after every 3-hole Match.

## Post-Match Gameplay Flow
After each 3-hole Match, a post-match cart girl break will begin. 
1) GM will generate clubs, clothes, shot modifiers, and abilities that will be available to the players
2) Players will take turns doing the following
   - choosing up to two clubs to swap from their bag (optional)
   - choosing a single article of clothing to swap out (optional)
   - choosing a single shot modifier to add to their shot pool
   - choosing a single ability to take (One only per golfer)
